# Even or Odd

## Description

I prepared this project to create a small application that allows a user to interact with data saved in my website. My goal is to learn how to incrementally develop, log and debug my project with using **java script**.

## Visual

This is the main page of the project:

![]()

## Installation

With the `Visual Studio Code` I prepared this project.

## Features

Java Script is very helpful with writing functions to group inputs. Console and the debugger helped me to understand what my code does do and to find my mistakes.

## Usage

With the help of functions users can group their inputs.

## Inspiration

Thanks to `HackYourFuture` for the inspiration of the page.

## Project status

I finished the project with using 6 branches and master branch.
